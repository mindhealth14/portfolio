                    What is Lorem Ipsum?
                    
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                    <h2> Back-end Web Development </h2>
                    <strong>In back-end development, my current technology stack includes Python, Django and PHP.</strong>

                    <p>I have personally handled the back-end development for nearly every projects I have launched in the past. 
                        To improve development speed, performance, and reliability, I have switched languages and frameworks multiple times, 
                        transitioning from PHP to Python and Django. Additionally, I have worked with various server configuration methods, 
                        starting from shell scripting, then using Celery, RabbitMQ, and now utilizing Docker ..... </p>

                    <P>The lessons I have learned from these experiences will continue to be valuable to me, 
                        regardless of the framework I use in my next project. </P>

                    <P> Regarding back-end development, I can:</P>
                    <ol>
                        <li> lead the development of back-ends using Python, Django</li>
                        <li> Serializers using Django REST Framework</li>
                        <li>split the back-end into separate domains and microservices,</li>
                        <li>collaborate with APIs, synchronize remote data, work with cloud servers, 
                            and bring in asynchronous workers whenever possible. </li>
                        <li>utilize different types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sqlite and Redis, </li>
                        <li>refactor existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions/classes/modules, extracting business logic from the request/response layer into separate modules,
                             and transitioning the system architecture into an event-based one. </li>
