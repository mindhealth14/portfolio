                    <h2> Back-end Web Development </h2>
                    <strong>In back-end development, my current technology stack includes Python, Django and PHP.</strong>

                    <p>I have personally handled the back-end development for nearly every projects I have launched in the past. 
                        To improve development speed, performance, and reliability, I have switched languages and frameworks multiple times, 
                        transitioning from PHP to Python and Django. Additionally, I have worked with various server configuration methods, 
                        starting from shell scripting, then using Celery, RabbitMQ, and now utilizing Docker ..... </p>

                    <P>The lessons I have learned from these experiences will continue to be valuable to me, 
                        regardless of the framework I use in my next project. </P>

                    <P> Regarding back-end development, I can:</P>
                    <ol>
                        <li> lead the development of back-ends using Python, Django</li>
                        <li> Serializers using Django REST Framework</li>
                        <li>split the back-end into separate domains and microservices,</li>
                        <li>collaborate with APIs, synchronize remote data, work with cloud servers, 
                            and bring in asynchronous workers whenever possible. </li>
                        <li>utilize different types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sqlite and Redis, </li>
                        <li>refactor existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions/classes/modules, extracting business logic from the request/response layer into separate modules,
                             and transitioning the system architecture into an event-based one. </li>
